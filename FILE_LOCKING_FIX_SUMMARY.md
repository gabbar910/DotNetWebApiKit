# File Locking Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
The DotNetWebAPIKit project was experiencing file locking errors when multiple users tried to authenticate or register simultaneously:

```
System.IO.IOException: The process cannot access the file 'usercreds.json' because it is being used by another process.
```

## Root Cause
The original UserService implementation used `File.ReadAllTextAsync` and `File.WriteAllTextAsync` without proper synchronization, causing race conditions when multiple threads/processes accessed the same file concurrently.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cross-Process Synchronization
- Added a static `Mutex` named "UserCredentialsFileMutex" for cross-process file access coordination
- Ensures only one process can access the file at a time

### 2. Thread-Safe File Operations
- Replaced direct file access with `FileStream` operations
- Implemented proper file locking with `FileShare.Read` for reading and `FileShare.None` for writing
- Added mutex-based synchronization with 10-second timeouts

### 3. Retry Logic
- Added robust retry mechanisms (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Handles temporary file access conflicts gracefully
- Specific handling for `IOException` and `UnauthorizedAccessException`

### 4. Atomic Write Operations
- Write to temporary files first, then atomically move to final location
- Use `File.Replace` for atomic updates to prevent corruption
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

### 5. Enhanced User Registration
- Made `CreateUserAsync` fully atomic to prevent race conditions
- Ensures duplicate username checks and user creation happen atomically
- Prevents concurrent registration conflicts

## Key Changes Made

### UserService.cs
1. **Added Static Mutex**: `private static readonly Mutex FileMutex`
2. **Enhanced LoadUsersAsync**: Thread-safe file reading with retry logic
3. **Enhanced SaveUsersAsync**: Thread-safe file writing with atomic operations
4. **Atomic CreateUserAsync**: Prevents race conditions during user registration
5. **Helper Methods**: `LoadUsersWithoutLockAsync` and `SaveUsersWithoutLockAsync` for internal use

### Test File
- Created `test-registration.http` for testing the registration functionality

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Stop the currently running application** (required to use updated code)
2. **Restart the application**: `dotnet run` in the DotNetWebAPIKit directory
3. **Test concurrent registration** using the provided test file or multiple simultaneous requests
4. **Verify no file locking errors** appear in the logs

## Testing Scenarios

### Using test-registration.http
1. Register multiple users simultaneously
2. Test duplicate username handling
3. Test password validation
4. Test email validation
5. Login with newly registered users

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:5189/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user1","password":"TestPass123","email":"user1@test.com"}'

# Terminal 2 (run simultaneously)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5189/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user2","password":"TestPass123","email":"user2@test.com"}'
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Multiple users can register simultaneously without errors**
✅ **Multiple users can authenticate concurrently without file conflicts**
✅ **File corruption is prevented through atomic operations**
✅ **Proper error handling and logging for troubleshooting**
✅ **Graceful retry logic handles temporary conflicts**

## Production Considerations

1. **Database Migration**: For production use, consider migrating from JSON file storage to a proper database (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Performance**: File-based storage with locking may become a bottleneck under high load
3. **Scalability**: Current solution works for single-server deployments; distributed deployments would need database storage
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for mutex timeout warnings to identify potential performance issues

## Files Modified
- `DotNetWebAPIKit/Services/UserService.cs` - Main implementation
- `DotNetWebAPIKit/test-registration.http` - Test scenarios

## Build Status
✅ Code compiles successfully with only minor StyleCop warnings
✅ All functionality preserved with enhanced thread safety
✅ Ready for testing after application restart
